I saw N3kowarrior make a port of Mora AI for every android phone but the battery...um sorry bad english :) i will call it overlay when the phone changer but N3kowarrior can't do, that all :)

This app made by BlackShark company, i just reverse engineer it. Also this is the fist version, the second version still under development.

# Build
Download the decompile.zip in release and use apktool 2.7.0 dirty (lastest on kali,debian,.. repo) I already patch the decompile.zip so you should build without any error (use aapt2 only, rememeber to sign your apk after build)
